                    <p>At Junub Debate Academy, we are dedicated to fostering a culture of critical thinking, eloquent
                        communication, and leadership among the youth of South Sudan. Our mission is to train
                        individuals who are passionate about debateâ€”whether they are aspiring debaters, debate coaches,
                        or even patrons who support debate as a tool for education and societal transformation.</p>
                    <p>Through rigorous training sessions, mentorship programs, and workshops, we ensure that our
                        participants acquire the skills needed to excel in debate both locally and internationally. We
                        focus on building confidence, enhancing public speaking abilities, and teaching the art of
                        persuasive argumentation.</p>
                    <p>One of our proudest achievements is selecting and preparing the best debaters to represent South
                        Sudan in international tournament. Under the Junub Debate Academy banner, these talented
                        individuals showcase their skills on global stages, bringing pride to our nation while gaining
                        exposure to diverse perspectives and cultures.</p>
