            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>At Joint Debate Society, we seek to empower young people with the art of public speaking, critical
                    thinking, and the ability to do research in order to make informed decisions.

                    We also need to use debating and public speaking as the platforms to contribute to peaceful
                    coexistence, social networking, and peer to peer learning.

                    we aim at raising leaders who are capable of solving their societal problems and contribute to the
                    sustainable world by accepting and challenging different ideas without resorting to conflict.

                <p>We envisage a South Sudan, Africa, and a world where young people have better communication
                    skills, sharp thoughts, and the ability to make informed decisions regarding their own societal
                    problems — where different ideologies don't bring conflicts but rather an opportunity to accept
                    them and use them meaningfully.</p>
